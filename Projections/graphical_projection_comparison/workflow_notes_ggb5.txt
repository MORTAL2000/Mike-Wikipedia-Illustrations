Note: There are font issues as well as transparency issues when exporting to SVG that are a result of GeoGebra 6 no longer having a "Transparent" or a "Export Text as Shapes" option in the export dialog. The exported image will acquire whatever font is used by default in InkScape, as well as a white background rectangle that will need to be removed. As a result, I recommend using GeoGebra 5 to generate the SVG files instead of GeoGebra 6.

POV-Ray
  1. Render the scenes as PNG at 1500x1500 pixels.
  2. Turn on the rendering of the corner spheres if you want to get their coordinates.

GeoGebra (version 5)
  1. Edit the GGB files in GeoGebra 5.
  2. Make sure the entire figure is visible in the application/browser window. You may have to enable/disable the Algebra pane.
  3. If the zoom scale gets messed up, press the "Resize (twice)" button twice.
  4. Export the file as SVG using the "Scale in cm: 100unit(s) = 1 cm" option.

InkScape
  1. Ungroup the drawing if necessary (possibly multiple times), and delete the outer black border and the "Resize (twice)" button.
  2. Open the "Export PNG Image" dialog.
  3. In the "Export area" section, press the "Page" button to recalibrate the export dimensions. The width and height should be 15.060cm by 15.060cm.
  4. In the "Image size" section, change the width and height to 1500 pixels. The DPI should equal 252.99.
  5. Select the output destination, and press the "Export" button. You may have to confirm to overwrite the destination file.
  6. Save the SVG document and exit InkScape.

GIMP
  1. Open the PNG image created in InkScape in GIMP.
  2. Open the PNG image created in POV-Ray in GIMP.
  3. Layer the first image over the second. Save the result as a new image.

XnView
  1. Create a contact sheet out of the new images in a 3x3 grid, specifying a spacing of 25px between the images.
