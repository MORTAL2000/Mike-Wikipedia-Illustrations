Note: There are font issues as well as transparency issues when exporting to SVG that are a result of GeoGebra 6 no longer having a "Transparent" or a "Export Text as Shapes" option in the export dialog. The exported image will acquire whatever font is used by default in InkScape, as well as a white background rectangle that will need to be removed. As a result, I recommend using GeoGebra 5 to generate the SVG files instead of GeoGebra 6.

POV-Ray
  1. Render the scenes as PNG at 1500x1500 pixels.
  2. Turn on the rendering of the corner spheres if you want to get their coordinates.

GeoGebra (version 5)
  1. Edit the GGB files in GeoGebra 5.
  2. Make sure the entire figure is visible in the application/browser window. You may have to enable/disable the Algebra pane to make room.
  3. If the zoom scale gets messed up, press the "Resize (twice)" button twice.
  4. Export the file as SVG using the "Scale in cm: 100unit(s) = 1 cm" option.

Notepad
  1. Open the SVG file in Notepad.
  2. Change the width and height to equal 15cm instead of 15.06cm.
  3. Save the SVG file and exit Notepad.

InkScape
  1. Open the SVG file in InkScape.
  2. Ungroup the drawing (possibly multiple times), and delete the outer black border, the "Resize (twice)" button, and the "Show Borders" checkbox if necessary.
  3. Open the "Export PNG Image" dialog.
  4. In the "Export area" section, press the "Page" button to recalibrate the export dimensions. Change the "Units" to "cm".
  5. In the "Image size" section, make sure the width and height are equal to 1500 pixels. Make sure the DPI is equal to 254.00.
  6. Select the output destination and file name, and press the "Export" button. You may be asked to confirm whether to overwrite the destination file.
  7. Save the SVG document and exit InkScape.
  8. If you open the SVG file in Notepad again you will see that the DPI is "254.00002" now. InkScape always adds the decimal portion at the end for some reason.

GIMP
  1. Open the PNG image created in InkScape in GIMP.
  2. Open the PNG image created in POV-Ray in GIMP.
  3. Layer the first image over the second. Save the result as a new image.

XnView
  1. Create a contact sheet out of the new images in a 3x3 grid, specifying a spacing of 25px between the images.
