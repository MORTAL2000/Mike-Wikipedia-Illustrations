# GeoGebra SVG export

Many of the illustrations in this collection were created using GeoGebra. As of 
2019, exported images suffer from scaling issues. See this thread for some tips 
on how to fix exported SVG images:

Once you have fixed an SVG image, you can then use the program InkScape to 
convert it to PNG or JPEG. Animated GIF will require additional steps.
