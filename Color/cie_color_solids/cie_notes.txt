COORDINATE AXES IMAGES
+ Originally black, then lightened by +50% in XnView using HLS tool. The result 
  is RGB(127,127,127).
+ The width of the axes images should be 1.375 times the width of the 
  coordinate axes. This equals 352/256 units in TeX, or 1100/800 pixels at 
  300dpi, or 440/320 units in POV-Ray.

OTHER
* I am concerned over whether I got the handedness of the illustrations right. 
  I.e. which axis is the x-axis, which axis is the y-axis, which axis is the 
  z-axis. Hopefully they are configured correctly.
* I've set tight limits on the size of the containers of the isosurfaces, but 
  there is not always a clear reason why to do this. I.e. The isosurfaces might 
  actually extend beyond these containers if allowed to.
